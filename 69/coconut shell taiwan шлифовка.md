## Activated Carbon Technology – Rabbit Air
Activated carbon is porous which means it has a large internal surface area. Impurities bond to pores of activated carbon via electrostatic attraction or chemisorption. Once the bonding sites are full, no additional impurities can be trapped. We use a raw material carbon base with a high carbon content, for optimal odor and chemical adsorption.
